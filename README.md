### üà≥ Adding a New Language

To add support for a new language, please follow these steps:

1. **Translate strings**

   * Copy and translate the [`strings.xml`](app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) file into your target language.
   * Save the translated file in a new directory using the appropriate locale code (e.g. `values-es/` for Spanish, `values-fr/` for French).

2. **Register the language**

   * Add an entry for the new language, including the locale and tag, in [`Languages.kt`](app/src/main/java/domilopment/apkextractor/utils/settings/Languages.kt).

3. **Update locale filters**

   * Add your language to the locale filter list in the build script at [`build.gradle.kts`](app/build.gradle.kts#L37).

4. **Submit a pull request**

   * Open a pull request with your changes.
   * Include a brief description and request a review from the maintainers.

### ‚úÖ Tips

* Make sure your locale code follows Android's [language and region standards](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization).
* Test your language selection in the app to ensure everything displays correctly.
* Keep translations consistent with the original tone and terminology.
