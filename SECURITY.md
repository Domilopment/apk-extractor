## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, report it at [domilopment@protonmail.com](mailto:domilopment@protonmail.com?subject=[Privacy%20Policy]%20APK%20Extractor%20Vulnerability)

To avoid vulnerabilities keep your installation up to date ([APK Extractor at Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=domilopment.apkextractor)) and check for updates regularly. If an active vulnerability is found, I will work to provide an update as fast as possible. Any further complications will receive an answer to a reported vulnerability per mail.
